# Changelog

## v0.8.0

* New features
  * Support filtering by OTP application. This uses the same mechanism as
    per-module filtering by automatically adding in all modules that are part of
    an OTP application. It is super useful! See the README.md. Thanks to Jon
    Carstons for adding this feature.
  * Support setting defaults on RingLogger clients so that you can configure
    things like a global default to info level messages and then only show
    debug messages from some applications

## v0.7.0

* New features
  * Added `save/1` to save the current set of log messages in the ring buffer to
    a file

## v0.6.1

* Bug fixes
  * Make `RingLogger.grep` friendlier by supporting strings as arguments

## v0.6.0

Important: `RingLogger.tail` is now `RingLogger.next`. `RingLogger.tail` shows
the last n lines of the log (default is 10).

* New features
  * `grep` greps the whole log entry rather than just the message portion. You
    can `grep` on timestamps and message levels now.
  * Functions that print log messages do the printing in the caller's context so
    that printing timeouts don't happen in RingLogger GenServers calls.
  * Added `:none` as a per-module log level to completely silence a module.
  * Added `:pager` option to specify a custom printer for the interactive
    commands.

## v0.5.0

* New features
  * Add support for changing the log levels on a per-module basis. Thanks to
    Matt Ludwigs for this change. See the README.md for details.
  * Add a `:format` option to accept a custom format function similar to how
    `Logger` supports custom formatting. Thanks to Tim Mecklem for this.
  * Bumped default ring buffer size from 100 messages to 1024.

* Bug fixes
  * Log clients are now fully configurable. Previous versions inadvertantly
    limited the options that could be set.

## v0.4.1

* Bug fixes
  * Fix crash when `grep`'ing iodata
  * Fix `init/1` callback return value when only specifying the module.

## v0.4.0

* New features
  * Added `grep`
  * Automatically add the backend if it's not running when using the IEx helpers

## v0.3.0

Renamed `LoggerCircularBuffer` to `RingLogger` and made backwards incompatible
API changes. Please review docs when upgrading.

* New features
  * Simplified use from IEx by autostarting the Client GenServer
  * Added support for `tail`ing logs

## v0.2.0

Renamed `LoggerCircularBuffer` to `LoggerCircularBuffer`

## v0.1.0
