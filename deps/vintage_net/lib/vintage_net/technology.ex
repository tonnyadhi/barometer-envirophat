  Normalize a configuration

  Technologies use this to update input configurations to a canonical
  representation. This includes things like inserting default fields,
  converting IP addresses passed in as strings to tuples, and deriving
  parameters so that they need not be derived again in the future.

  Configuration errors raise exceptions.

  @doc """
  Convert a technology-specific configuration to one for VintageNet

  The `config` is the normalized configuration map (`normalize/1` will have
  been called at some point so the technology does not need to call it again).

  The `opts` parameter contains VintageNet's application environment. This
  contains potentially useful file paths and other information.

  Configuration errors raise exceptions. Errors should be infrequent, though,
  since VintageNet will call `normalize/1` first and expects most errors to be
  caught by it.

  Handle an ioctl that has been requested on the network interface

  The function runs isolated in its own process and only one ioctl is
  guaranteed to be running at a time. `VintageNet` will handle crashes and
  hangs and unceremoniously kill the ioctl if the user changes their mind and
  reconfigures the network interface.

  Ioctl support is optional. Examples of `ioctl`s include:

  * `:scan` - scan for WiFi networks
  * `:statistics` - return a map of network statistics
