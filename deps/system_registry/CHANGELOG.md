# SystemRegistry

## v0.8.2

* Bug fixes
  * Update SystemRegistry.Task to use new supervisor spec

## v0.8.1

* Bug fixes
  * Updated docs and simplified code
  * Remove superfluous calls to `Processor.Server.apply/1`
  * Prevent calls to `Kernel.get_in/3` from raising an exception

## v0.8.0

* Enhancements
  * Decouple producers from global state server.

    Prior to 0.8.0, committing transactions would block system_registry until the
    transaction was applied or rejected. Callers are now detached from the global
    state server.

    Important note:
    This change in behaviour means that transactions that fail validation
    will not return an error immediately. Instead, if a process is interested
    in errors, the transaction option `notify_on_error: true` must be set.

## v0.7.0

* Enhancements
  * Moved Term Storage out to its own app

## v0.6.1

* Enhancements
  * Fix Elixir 1.6 warnings

## v0.6.0

* Enhancements
  * Added `SystemRegistry.Task` for a supervised process that executes a function
  anytime the contents of a given system_registry scope changes.

## v0.5.0

* Enhancements
  * Added simple persistence mainly for use with the
  `SystemRegistry.Processors.Config` processor.
* Bug Fixes
  * Processor behaviour passes all call / cast through to the implementation.

## v0.4.0

* Enhancements
  * SystemRegistry.Processor.Config no longer requires the top level application to declare the priorities. Defaults to `[:debug, :_, :default]` which allows `:_` to be used to represent any applications that have not been specifically declared.

## v0.3.0

* Bug Fixes
  * register will not return the current state for the key. Instead, the registrant will queue a message.
  * added update_in/3 for modifying the value of a scope in a transaction

## v0.2.1

* Bug Fixes
  * Deleting a node would cause all node bindings to be deleted.

## v0.2.0

* Enhancements
  * nodes and their values can be moved to another node
* Bug Fixes
  * deleting an inner node did not delete all leaf nodes

## v0.1.2

* Bug Fixes
  * Prevent inter nodes from being turned into leaf nodes if not all leafs are owned in :global
  * Clean up bindings when converting inter nodes to leafs

## v0.1.1

* Bug Fixes
  * Processes were being monitored multiple times
  * State processor was not handling deletes properly
